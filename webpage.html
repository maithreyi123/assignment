                    <p>Chocolate is a range of foods derived from cocoa (cacao), mixed with fat and finely powdered sugar to produce a solid confectionery.
                         There are several types of chocolate, classified according to the proportion of cocoa.
                         Dark chocolate has more cacao (the beans that chocolate are made from) and less sugar than other chocolates, so it is considered healthier than milk.
                         Dark chocolate contains lots of antioxidants that help the cardiovascular system by reducing blood pressure
                         Eating dark chocolate widens arteries and promotes healthy blood flow that can prevent the buildup of plaque that can block arteries.
                         Eating dark chocolate every day reduces the risk of heart disease by 1/3.
                         The Guinness World Record for the largest chocolate bar in the world was set by Thorntons PLC in the United Kingdom on September 07, 2011, and weighed 5792.50 kg.

                            <p>
                                    Milk chocolate is solid chocolate made with milk added in the form of milk powder, liquid milk, or condensed milk. In 1875, Swiss confectioner Daniel Peter, in cooperation with his neighbour Henri Nestlé in Vevey, developed the first solid milk chocolate using condensed milk. The bar was named "Gala Peter", combining the Greek word for "milk" and his name.

                           <p>Dark chocolate, also known as "plain chocolate" or "black chocolate", is produced using higher percentages of cocoa, traditionally with cocoa butter instead of milk, but there are also dark milk chocolates and many degrees of hybrids. Dark chocolate can be eaten as is, or used in cooking, for which thicker, baking bars, usually with high cocoa percentages ranging from 70% to 100% are sold. </p>

                            <p> White chocolate is a chocolate derivative. It commonly consists of cocoa butter, sugar and milk solids and is characterized by a pale yellow or ivory appearance. The melting point of cocoa butter, its primary cocoa bean component, is high enough to keep white chocolate solid at room temperature.

                             <p>
                            Organic chocolate is chocolate which has been certified organic. As of 2016, it was a growing sector in the global chocolate industry. organic chocolate is a socially-desirable product for some consumers. Brands like  The Hershey Company, have begun to produce organic chocolate.
                            Make your tastebuds work for it. We use 85% cocoa solids for an intense hit of cocoa.Like everything we do, it's balanced with just enough sugar.

                               Raw chocolate is chocolate which is produced in a raw or minimally-processed form. It is made from unroasted (sun-dried) cacao beans and cold pressed cacao butter. A variety of crystalline and liquid sweeteners may be used, including: coconut sugar, coconut nectar, xylitol, agave nectar, maple syrup, and stevia. Cane sugar and other highly processed sugars are not used, but this is no evidence of being less harmful.

                               Modeling chocolate, also called chocolate leather, plastic chocolate or candy clay, is a chocolate paste made by melting chocolate and combining it with corn syrup, glucose syrup, or golden syrup.[1] Primarily used by upscale cakemakers and pâtisseries to add decoration to cakes and pastries, modeling chocolate is formed into a variety of shapes and structures that cannot be easily accomplished with other softer  materials.

                                This rich chocolate shortbread recipe is easy to prepare and keeps for several days in an airtight container.
                                Because this mixture is already dark, it's hard to tell when the shortbread browns.
                                Check your oven temperature using an oven thermometer, and bake just until the shortbread is set.</p>

                                There are many methods to make this chocolate recipe but the one which works great for me is the sugar syrup method. 
                                The secret to making that perfect homemade chocolate that will give any store bought chocolate a run for its money is in preparing the sugar syrup to one string consistency.</p>
